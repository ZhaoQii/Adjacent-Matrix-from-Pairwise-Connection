# Adjacent-Matrix-from-Pairwise-Connection
Create Adjacent Matrix from Pairwise Connection raw data in Python. As you can see in our example data file, each row of it shows one pairwise connection from one station to another (so you may regard it as "edge" in graph theory). And my code here create the adjacent matrix based on this kind of raw data file.
